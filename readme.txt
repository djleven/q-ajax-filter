== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this plugin create the AJAX Filters? =

You need to use the ajaxFilter shortcode - for example:

[ajaxFilter post_type="property" taxonomies="property_type, location, price, size" filter_position="horizontal" filter_type="select"]

= How can I style the AJAX content =

The plugin includes a very simple HTML template wrapped in an <article> tag, this can be replaced by copying the included file "templates/ajax-filter.php" to your active theme at:

THEME/library/templates/ajax-filter.php

This follows the file system structure used by all Q themes and plugins.

= What are the shortcode arguments? =

The shortcode accepts the following arguments:

- post_type ( post types seperated by commas )
- taxonomies ( taxonomies seperated by commas )
- filter_position ( "horizontal" OR "vertical" )
- filter_type ( "select" OR "list" )
